# Deployment Guides for LibreChat Open Source Application

This documentation aims to provide you with a clear and concise starting point for deploying the LibreChat application across various environments and platforms.

Please note that this guide does not aim to replace the official documentation provided by the deployment services listed below. Instead, it serves to complement those resources by offering a consolidated jumpstart into the deployment process. It's important to recognize that the platforms detailed in this guide are not directly comparable, as they originate from different domains and cater to varying needs.

You will find that some deployment methods involve installing on Ubuntu, while others integrate directly with the platform's native offerings. It's also worth mentioning that, in the current version of these guides, there may be overlapping or nonidentical clones of the deployment processâ€”even for parts that are essentially the same across different platforms.

We are aware of this redundancy and plan to streamline the documentation in the future. The goal is to create a unified guide for the common aspects of the deployment process, reserving the specific guides for the unique elements inherent to each platform. We encourage the community to contribute to this effort and help us refine and enhance these guides.

Below is a comparative overview of the various deployment options available for LibreChat, highlighting the main advantages and disadvantages of each. This table is intended as a starting point to help you choose the best environment for your specific requirements.
