# UI Changes
- [ ] Find all bg-xyz-123 and text-xyz-123 and replace them with colos which openai uses like bg-main-surface-primary and others, so we won't need anything like dark:stuff and it'll be easy to use the colors
- [ ] Phase out style.css, remove all the extra css in style.css make it clean
- [ ] Phase out old legacy duplicate code

This P.R cannot do all of this, but is aiming to do the first or second one in a period of time.
