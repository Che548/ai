# Artifact Hub repository metadata file
#
# This file is used by Artifact Hub to:
# - Verify the publisher (Verified publisher flag) when the repositoryID is set.
# - Claim repository ownership via the owners field.
# - Exclude specific packages via the ignore field.
#
# For Helm chart repositories, this file must be served at the same level as the index.yaml.
